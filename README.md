## generative art

#### purpose
a repository to keep some generative art and the like both for ease of backing up and sharing.

#### dependencies
all of the code is written in python and then run using python mode for processing.

python mode for processing can be found at this link: https://py.processing.org/

#### images
this directory holds examples of the art, the naming system is matches the script name and the time of creation. i would like to work in something where smaller examples are saved in a more compressed format so that people can view the examples directly on github. 

#### sketches
this is a quick overview and explanation of each of the scripts
###### circles
inspired by kandinsky's 'squares with concentric circles', which also happens to be one of the first painting's i copied when i was younger and got into an art show with. Uses randomized values and recursion to generate circles

###### curvy-pollock
inspired by jackson pollock, one of my favorite modern artists, so i decided to create my own take on his work.

###### tin-wool
a take on a reddit post i saw, using randomness and some trigonometry (first time since physics) to create randomized lines within circles



#### other stuff
feel free to fork/build off of this code, that's why its on github.
